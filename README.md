# Data Analysis of the Bicycle Sharing Scheme in London UK

## Exploratory data analysis

Using Transport for London (TfL) public bicycle data for 2019 for the city of London, I've completed a series of exploratory data plots to highlight the use of public city bicycles, or Santander bicycles, over this period by the London population. The Python code for the exploratory data analysis is contained in the folder of the same name, together with the plots themselves in the plots subfolder. The cycling data can be retrieved at TfL's [Open Data web site for cycling data](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/). For my analysis I've downloaded the data from January 2019 to May 2020, and I've stored it in a SQLite database which due to its size (over 2 Gb) I haven't uploaded to this GitHub repository.

The exploratory data analysis folder contains plots for:
