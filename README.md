# Analysis of Santander Bicycles for Transport for London

Using public TfL bicycle data from 2012 to 2016 for the city of London, I've completed a series of data visualization plots to highlight the public use of the bicycles over this period. The data consists of start and end journey dates, journey durations, start and end bicycle stations with geospatial coordinates and net fluxes of bicycles from each station.

In the exploratory data analysis folder are placed the plots for:

 * Average number of rides per hour on weekdays and weekends
 * Histogram of average bike ride duration per weekdays and weekends
 * Histogram of average number of journeys per bike per weekdays and weekends
 * Number of rides per month
 * Number of rides per day from 2012-01-04 to 2016-03-08
 * Number of rides per hour on weekdays and weekends
