# Analysis of Santander Bicycles for Transport for London

Using public TfL bicycle data from 2012 to 2016 for the city of London, I've completed a series of data visualization plots to highlight the use of the public city bicycles, or Santander bicycles, over this period. 

<!-- I've also created an interactive scatter plot with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) to show average daily bicycle traffic in London. -->
